## About

I am aware that another [similar project](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram) already exists, however this is project contains some different features that some may find useful, including a description of each method, the inclusion of deprecated methods, the property initializer and the error handling lifecycle.

Created in - you guessed it - React!
