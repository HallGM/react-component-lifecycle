# React Component Lifecycle

>>>>[Go to App](https://hallgm.github.io/react-component-lifecycle/)<<<<

This is an app for learning about React component lifecycle methods. It contains an interactive diagram to help you visualize the different lifecycle methods used in React components.

Click on the method to see a short descrition of what it does. You can also select at the top whether to include less common methods and deprecated methods.

I am aware that another [similar project](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram) already exists, however this is project contains some diferent features that some may find useful, including a description of each method, the inlcusion of deprecated methods, the property Initializer and the error handling lifecycle.
